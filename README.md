- **Real-Time Performance Analysis:** Track and compare performance data dynamically with interactive graphs and trend analysis.
- **Map Visualization:** Draw and update cyclists' routes on interactive maps using GPS data.
- **Advanced Analytical Dashboards:** Customized dashboards provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and trend analysis.
- **Data Import and Export:** Import and export training data in various formats for external analysis or sharing with other platforms.

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python
- PostgreSQL
- Poetry

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash

   MAIL_USERNAME=cyclearninfo@gmail.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=udnc oadv dxsh pwtv
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgres://YourUserName:YourPassword@YourHostname:YourPort/YourDatabaseName
   TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://YourUserName:YourPassword@YourHostname:YourPort/YourDatabaseName
  
- Insert valid uris for SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI and TEST_DATABASE_URL

- TEST_DATABASE_URL should contain the same database as the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI, it's just meant for testing purposes

5. Starting the Backend Server
- Navigate to the `ast_monitor_web/run.py` and run it 

## Frontend Setup

### Prerequisites
